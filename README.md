## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage âœ…
- Search for a country using an `input` field âœ…
- Filter countries by region âœ…
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page âœ…
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page âœ…
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_ âœ…

## My process

### Built with

- [Typescript](https://reactjs.org/) - For strong typing
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
  - [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - Routing
  - [React Query (Tanstack)](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview) - JS library
  - [React Spring](https://www.react-spring.dev/) - Animation library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) - Build tool
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I basically used this project to improve my Typescript skills. I learned a couple of techniques for efficiently typing variables.
One of my favourite things I used a lot in this project was the `Pick` _Mapped Type_, basically the opposite of `Omit` (as I've come to learn). Pretty handy for reusing types from an existing type without having to manually type them.

An example of somewhere I used it was to type the `CountryCard` _props_;

```ts
type CountryCardProps = Pick<
  Country,
  "flags" | "name" | "population" | "region" | "capital" | "continents" | "cca2"
> & { index: number };

function CountryCard(props: CountryCardProps) {
  // ...
}
```

Just beautiful! ðŸ˜‹

I also made the decision to try out _React Spring_ for animation, instead of the usual _Framer Motion_ I'm used to. It was a rather basic use, but I got a practical feel for how it works

I also tried my best to store `search` and `filter` state in the _URL_ so it works seamlessly even when you paste in something like;

```
https://fm-rest-countries-one.vercel.app/?search=Nigeria&filter=Africa
```

The [link](https://fm-rest-countries-one.vercel.app/?search=Nigeria&filter=Africa) works as it should! ðŸ¥³

### Continued development

I'll just keep building my Typescript skills. It's fun!
